         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>There was a plaine honest man and a good Gamester, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to fall into the hands of some notorious cheaters, in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Tables: the honest man being over watch'd having much the better of the set, fell asleep, which the cheat that plaied with him, taking advantage of, turned the Tables, and calling to some of his <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I will not mistrust the Readers wisdom so much, as to make an Application hereof, otherwise then as far as it concerns the Author of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Kings Book: he meanes to get the victory by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the two Tables, <hi>viz.</hi> by calling good evill, and evill good; that the Author hath done so already I need no greater argument then this, at the enterance of his book, he saies, that what he hath written therein is well done, and those who speak evil against it are wicked men: thus the black men are become white, and the white black.</p>
               <p>The next thing we meet with in the entry of this book, is, with a very strong engagement of his pen, and that was <hi>necessity,</hi> not any the least malice or ill will, which the Author bare to the Dead King: truly, there is no better way, herein to confute this man, then to believe him; he was <hi>necessitated</hi> thereunto.

               <p>The justice or injustice of <hi>Straffords</hi> death were as impertinent for me to dispute by way of answer, as it was in you by way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for what if he deserved never so highly to die? what is that to the Kings Conscience, if he did not think so? The King might very well lament a concession to any thing that was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own Conscience, yet is not bound to be sensible of those things which are in your judgment greater faults (if it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he were guilty of those things you take for granted) You shall never perswade any man to lay a plaister to his arm, who is sensible of the wound its being in his head: If the Kings Conscience was wounded concerning the businesse of <hi>Strafford,</hi> he must apply the plaister to that wound, and not be judged by your sense, for no man feels a wound but he that hath it: If that be a Block to him, that seems a Straw to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Can any man but blush for you, that you should thus judge, when you know the King neither did any such thing, nor was there, and for ought you know, knew not of any such thing, untill it was done? and if he had done it himself, with his own Sword, in his own Hand, were it not a bold judgment given, that the Kings Life-Bloud should be let out out of all the parts of his Body, as a <hi>just judgment,</hi>

               <p>For your shamelesse assertion, that no <hi>attempt</hi> was ever made, nor <hi>any affront offered</hi> by these Tumultuaries, whereby there was <hi>no such prostitution of the Majestis of the late Kings Place or Person, of the safety of his Wife and Children,</hi> to be imagined: I know not what grounds you have to be so confident; but I can answer you in your own words, that <hi>this I can truly and confidently averr,</hi> that I heard them say, a little before they were slash'd from the Court Gate, That if the King would not do as he ought to do, they would take the Crown from off his Head, and put it upon the head of him that should.</p>
               <p>For your next exception, <hi>viz.

               <p>Neither will you allow, that it was <hi>an act unparallel'd by any of the late King's Predecessors;</hi> and why so? because <hi>some of the former Kings had passed Acts for a Parliament once a year;</hi> is the man out of his wits? doth the man know what he saith? the King saith He hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to His Parliament an <hi>Act of unparallel'd confidence,</hi> His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must have reference then to that Act which was not <hi>parallel'd,</hi> and not to that which was; though <hi>the Bill</hi> for Trienniall Parliaments was parallel'd by former Kings, yet the Bill for <hi>setling this during the pleasure of the two Houses</hi> was never parallel'd by any.

               <p>You cry, <hi>let all the world be judge by the whole course of the late King's Reigne, whether He thought a CONTINƲAL PARLIAMENT,&amp;c.</hi> what's this to the purpose? what hath the <hi>continuall course of His Reigne</hi> to do with His (then) thoughts at the passing of that Bill? it may be He thought otherwise before; is it not likely that a man may have second thoughts? or that those may be best? the <hi>King</hi> was at a stand it is likely at the passing of the Bill; He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with Himself; what if I grant them this? they can aime at nothing else but <hi>the preservation of the Laws, in their due execution and vigour,</hi> that is but <hi>tuning the Common-wealth,</hi> no putting me out of <hi>tune,</hi> for <hi>my interest lies therein as much as any mans:</hi> therefore I will grant them their request; what a great piece of businesse is here <hi>of of pealing to all the world, whether this be agreeable to the whole course of this late King's Reigne,</hi> it need not; nor you to have made any such out-cry.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> saies it did not <hi>soon repent Him of the setling that Act:</hi> you say it did; who knows best? the <hi>King</hi> demanded the key, and the staffe, of the Earls of <hi>Essix</hi> and <hi>Holland: Ergo,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> repented that He had past the Bill for setling the Parliament: I do meet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114632:15"/> with many consequences now and then; but his reason is, because the Earls chose to obey His Writ before His private commands: whether they did so or no, or what His commands were, I cannot tell, but I thinke I may take away My key, or My staffe out of any of My servants hands, without repenting Me of any Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for His sending for His servants, where should they be but with their Master? is there any Act of Parliament against it?</p>
               <p>Wherefore (thou bad <hi>Genius)</hi> It was <hi>not more Princely, then friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributions, which the late King granted towards the perpetuating of our happinesse.</hi> And for your slandering the good King with His <hi>going about some designe or other, at the very time of those grants, which</hi> (you say) <hi>if they had taken effect, would not only have deprived us of the fruit of those Bils, but would have reduced us to a worse condition of confusion, then that wherein the Parliament found us:</hi> if a man should aske you what <hi>designe or other</hi> that was, I believe you would be much to seeke for an answer that should be satisfactory, you should have done well to have let us known; I never knew a face that deserved never so much to be spit upon, but the man that own'd the face, would wipe off the spittle, though he had never a handkerchief in his pocket.</p>
               <p>But now for his making those <hi>following arguments</hi> (which proves that the late King did not repine at <hi>the establishment, and to endeavour by force and open hostility, to undoe what by His Royall assent he had done)</hi> so frivolous.</p>
               <p>He will not admit by any meanes <hi>that it would have argued folly in the King to have granted them such power, if He had intended to have forced them asunder:</hi> and why will he not admit this? <hi>v. z.</hi> because <hi>all wise men knew, that the late King knowing that He could not</hi> (if they would) <hi>have dissolved them, but with apparent danger to Himself,</hi> and therefore He did but <hi>seem to yeild, to make them the more secure, and the people lesse jealous, &amp;c.</hi> why, what would they have done to Him, if He had kept the power in His own hands, to have dissolved the Parliament at His pleasure? they could not have set up a High Court of Justice to cut off His Head: the danger (you see) was in doing as He did: there had been none, or not so much, if He had not done so; feed a bird and he'l shite upon your hand.</p>

               <p>For her <hi>Loyalty as a Subject,</hi> which the Book saith was in the Queen, so that the King could not be Author of the Book; he gives his reasons, because <hi>shee entertained the Popes</hi> Nuntio, <hi>who acted contrary to the Law, practised the life of the late King, as appears in a Book Intituled, ROMES MASTER-PIECE:</hi> but if thee entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a <hi>Nuntio</hi> from the Devill, he could not have acted so contrary to the Law, or practised such things against the life of our late King, as may be seen in a Book, that may very well be Intituled, <hi>ENGLANDS MASTER-PIECE:</hi> The last is the prettiest argument of all: why this could not be the Kings Book, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Book charges the Parliament with <hi>driving the Queen out of the Kingdome, as necessary for their designes:</hi> what designes? if you wil neither beleeve the designes, which the King saith they had, nor tell us what other designes you meane, we cannot imagine any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther designe, except you should thinke that the Queen did all: and so shee being out of the Kingdome, the King could never compile so rare a Book without her assistance: was there ever such <hi>non-se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiturs</hi> twisted together in ropes, to hall down non-sence, on so faire a piece?

               <p>Againe, I do not think the King the Author of the War, though he should draw the first Sword: Is the thief upon the high-way, that cries, stand, or the honest man (if he should draw his Sword first) the occasion of the quarrell? (if there should be any sighting) truly I am perswaded the King was bid stand, when the <hi>Militia</hi> was demanded from him, of which the Scepter was the en bleme: I thinke he which bids the King to deliver the Scepter out of his hand, bids a greater matter to be delivered, then the purse out of a mans pocket, the robber useth no violence except you refuse; and they told the King, that if he refused, they should be forced to take the course which God should direct them, which is to the same in effect; but if I might be judge, I should think that they which gave the first Commission to kill, and slay, began the War, who ever gave the first blow; it is not he that first strikes, but he that first drawes makes the quarrell: and I am sure the Parliaments Commission bare date before the Kings, both weeks and daies.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114632:27"/> to dispute the point, and clear it to His judgment; professing, that could it be made out to be dissonant to the Gospel Government, He would most willingly agree to its abolition:</hi> This, you say, <hi>was a meer pretence to delude the world, because</hi> (say you) <hi>if the Oath were indispensable, what good could the Divines do by convincing His judgment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes: if they could have convinc'd His judgment, that Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was <hi>dissonant to Gospel Government,</hi> the indispensability of His Oath would soon have fallen to the ground: God forbid that he should keep such an Oath as was (any way) against the Gospel.</p>
               <p>You are very much offended at the Authors making the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments meaning contrary to their saying; <hi>viz. while they invited the late King to come, yet they could not but be pleased with His absence.</hi> It is possible that a man may grope for that which he would be loath to find—if they esteem no better of Him.</p>
               <p>What arguments are here? <hi>viz. If the late King had no hopes of an Army, I pary, why was the Queen and the Crown-jewels sent into Holland?</hi> To which an answer is easily made, the Queen was in <hi>Holland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause She could not be here; and the Crown-jewels were with the Queen, because the King trusted His Wife with them.

               <p>But now to the <hi>conclusion of the Chapter, and your observation upon the phrase,</hi> viz. <hi>God knows, the late King was as far from meditating a War, as He was in the eie of the world for having preparation for one:</hi> This you confute, by making it <hi>appear to the world, that He bad preparations for a

               <p>IN this Chapter you offer to make it appear, That <hi>the Parliaments conceiving Jealousies of the late Kings commanding, or countenancing, or contriving the Rebellion in</hi> Ireland, <hi>was not out of malice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely their duty did not bind them to brand their Soveraign with such a crime, upon no other grounds but <hi>Jealousies,</hi> they should have been sure of it first: but I will observe your charge against him, <hi>In the manner of his carriage, in order to the suppression of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though that Rebellion brake out the 23 of</hi> October, <hi>the Parlianent could obtain no Proclamation against is untill</hi> January.</p>
               <p>The King offered to go against them in Person, upon the first hearing of their breaking out, which was more then a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but you durst not trust him: if you had, it could not have been worse there nor here; it may be better in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>As to your cavill at the Kings words, <hi>viz. Next to the sin of those who began that Rebellion, theirs must needs be, who either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>indred the speedy suppressing of it by Domestick dissentions, or diverted aids:</hi> For your asking the question, <hi>viz. What shall we judge of the late King?</hi> I answer you, by asking the question, <hi>What shall we judge of the present Parliament?</hi> who converted the Monies which were raised for the war in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to perpetrate a needlesse and groundlesse war in <hi>England?</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114632:31"/> the Forces which were raised for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and perverted their hands into one anothers bowels? whilst the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> daily gain'd upon the English Forces there, untill they were (almost) all starv'd for want of all reliefe. <hi>Who exasperated the Rebels to desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by that Ʋn-Evangelicall resolution to destroy that Nation root and branch.</hi>

               <p>You <hi>are certain it is so disputable, that all the brains and stairs on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's party, even to the very apex of a Bishop, cannot disprove it:</hi> It may be they are not so well at proving of Negatives, as you are: they can prove Episcopacy in our Saviour, in the Apostles, in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> they can prove the practice of it all along, do you shew the <hi>Hiatus;</hi> do you, that are so good at Negatives, prove when it was not; shew us the gap; who made it; when and where it lies and upon what occasion; if you had done this, you had done some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; otherwise you bring but chaffe to the mill, instead of corn.</p>
               <p>Are not you a fine man to ground your opinion of this Books not being the late Kings, upon so weak disproofs or feigned proofs of <hi>folly and passions</hi> therein contain'd? whereby you would prove it to be none of so wise and patient a Prince his Book; and upon so slender an occasion, to hazard your reputation, in calling a King Fool? <hi>Ei à Barde, ei à fatue.</hi>

               <p>To your other, <hi>viz. Surely in matters of Religion those truths gain most on mens judgments and consciences, which are least urged by secular violence, which weakens truth with prejudices:</hi> If this be true, say you, <hi>why did your Metropolitan so set the late King to war against the Scots, for denying Episc pacy, and a Popish Liturgy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not for denying Episcopacy, but for rising up in arms to pull down Episcopacy, and to resist the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You are very much mistaken, that the Author <hi>cals</hi> Episcopacy an evil spirit; for, he saith, <hi>you</hi> make it so.

               <p>You say, <hi>we ought only in such points as these, to plead things which are authentick, according to the Apostles times, rules, and actions,</hi> then we should have no Churches, or congregations, but in woods, groves, or private houses; we should have no B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Because our Doctor dare not deny, but that the mistery of iniquity which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in</hi> Pauls <hi>time, was in six hundred years grown to a damnable height,</hi> Ergo, <hi>we must draw our discipline from them, as well as our Dostrine:</hi> no reason at all, except we can prove that the Discipline is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as well as the Doctrine: <hi>hold you to the rules of the government of the Gospell,</hi> and you will find no such government as Presbyterie, or Lay Elders.</p>
               <p>If so, saith the Confuter, <hi>why may not the Parliament of England, &amp;c?</hi> where do you find that in the Gospel? where do you find in

               <p>Sir, There was a Parliament man, one of the wisest amongst them, who began to be something weary of the House (because Reason had not been turn'd up trump a long time, and he thought there was so much juggling, that he fear'd it never would be) left it; some of his Friends asked him the reason, why he did not go unto the House, as formerly he was accustomed? He answered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114632:36"/> he did not find the Parliament like former Parliaments: O, said his Friend, you should not have left them for that, but have staid there, and have given them reasons, and you might have recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied what was amisse: the Parliament man asked his Friend, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no he could play at ruffe? his Friend told him, that he could: then, saith he, I will put you the case; you play your ten of clubs, I take it with my King; I go to take up the trick, you bid me, hold: I ask you the reason; you say, because it is your trick: I tell you, it is my King; you deny it: I ask you, what it is then? you tell me, the nine of clubs: I think you are mad, I tell you so; I offer to be judged by all the standers by; you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; 'tis put to the vote, and they all judge it to be the nine of clubs, and not the King: Where are you then? So except this Confuter should get such a pack of resolv'd Knaves as these, he would not find a man, in the Kingdom, that would say, that this Book, either for phrase or matter therein contained, were either botch'd or bungled, or not his, or inferiour to any that ever the presse printed, or a pen did write; except alwaies to be excepted, his Masters, the King of Kings his Book: And as I think no man could have writ such a Book, but King <hi>Charls;</hi> so I am confident, he could never have writ such a piece, had he not been in trouble: <hi>When I am in heavinesse,</hi> saith <hi>David, I will complain:</hi> 'Tis a sad heart that we are beholding to, for most of <hi>David's</hi> Psalms, and <hi>Charls</hi> his Meditations.</p>
               <p>For your converting the Kings words to another meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> that for the matter contained in the Book; sober and learned men have sufficiently <hi>proved it offensive, as we see at large in a book In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The mistake, is the making no difference between tautologie and vaine repetition; for the often reiterating of the same words, may be an argument of the vehemency of the Spitit; as we are use to do when we perswade a man to what we have an earnest desire he should grant; but repetitions are termed vaine, because foolish and superstitious people thinke to be heard for their much bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>Item, <hi>It was taken out of the Masse Book, and almost the same with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do we measure how near we are to truth, by remotenesse from <hi>Romes</hi> Liturgie, or by our nearnesse to Gods word? the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is confessed by all reformed Churches, to be most sound and orthodox; this Book of Common-Prayer (as the King observes) was exactly conformed to that Doctrine; if the Masse-Book be almost the same (by the profession of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches) it should rather render the Masse-Book lesse blamable, then ours any way culpable.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth dayes, it was put to the Vote, whether or no, they should utterly renounce the old Liturgle, because some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions were in it, and make a new, or else retaine the old, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punging the errours, that should be found to be in it.</p>
               <p>They all cried a new, a new one, away with the old one, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> stood up and told them, it would more declare their innocency, and carry with it a lesse shew of any schismaticall intentions, if they should raze out all its errours, that <hi>Rome</hi> her selfe might see, that we did not for sake her, but her errours; and hereupon their mindes were altered, and the Book continued rectified as now it is, and the only absolute Liturgie in the world.</p>

               <p>In the Ecclesiasticall Histories you shall find that the Christian enemies used to scoffe at the Christians, for being worshippers of a God that was hang'd, whereupon the Primitive Christians wore crosses, cross'd themselves, their children, their me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Masse-Book cannot hear you if you do give never so many thankes: but if you do mean it to be scandalous to be beholding to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for your Liturgie, why should the Church of <hi>England</hi> make it more scandalous, then to be beholding to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for her conversion and succession, which she must be beholding to her whether she will or no? It is a signe the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not hungry, when they wrangle so about the dishes and neglect the meat.</p>

               <p>Item, <hi>Should the matter of it</hi> (you say) <hi>be without exception, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Church indeed is compared to a ship, tossed upon the waves, and persecuted by the winds; but we must note, that as the Confuter compares the Liturgie to a compass which teacheth them to steer, so the Liturgie to a Mast, to which we are necessitated: why will he then deprive the Ship, the Church, from a thing so necessary for her good, as a Mast is for a Ship?</p>
               <p>But in the next break, rather then the Doctor shall have his wil, the Ship shall have neither Mast nor Compasse; <hi>Liturgie</hi> nor <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;</hi> are these your truths illustrations? close positions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ʋpon what ground</hi> the King said, <hi>viz. that one of the greatest faults some men found with the Common-Prayer Book, was this, that it taught men to pray so oft for him:</hi> the sequell hath sufficiently declared.</p>
               <p>One argument of yours I had almost over-slipt, but it makes no matter, if I go back againe to take it up, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>example</hi> which you say you have from <hi>our Saviour,</hi> against any set forme of Prayer,

                  <hi>precepted</hi> or <hi>enjoyned,</hi> out of these words, <hi>Math. 6. 9. When you pray, pray after this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I take to be an absolute injunction and precept of a set form of prayer; for when I bid you say after this manner, it is more commonly taken according to the idioms of our language, as a command for us to say the very same words, then words to that effect: And if we compare one place of Scripture with another, you will find it to be so: For <hi>Luke</hi> the 11. and the 2. you will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find the word <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> neither <hi>after</hi> nor before: But, <hi>when you pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, Although there were some prayers for Bishops, though not so <hi>many</hi> as for his Majestie; yet the same prayers were for you, if you were either a Pastor or a Curate: but there were none for <hi>Doctors;</hi> the saddle did not wring the Doctor there: this may be the King's Book for all this.</p>

               <p>You say, <hi>His forlorn hope is commanded by policy:</hi> you are out in the very beginning; for Episcopacy is no forlorn hope, yet it may happen to be Chaplain to the Regiment: you will not allow the King his reason, where he saith, <hi>Reason of State induced the late King to approve that Government above the other:</hi> Here you are out again, for <hi>inducement</hi> is no <hi>Commander.</hi> You say, <hi>this is false;</hi> and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you find the late King saying, <hi>It was impossible for a Prince to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the State in quiet, except he have such an influence upon Church-men, and they such dependance upon him:</hi> This is a great deal of truth, and very good <hi>policy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You turn the Kings reason into your, <hi>sic volo;</hi> for you only <hi>say,</hi> the King cannot preserve the State in quiet, except he do alter the Government: But, <hi>de exclusione verbum nullum;</hi> not a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>shutting out, and shutting in of peace and loyaltie, with the prevailing Oratory of those, who with the keys of heaven, can so far open or

               <p>The King shews his reason for Episcopacy, out of Scripture, for its practice, in the Apostles times &amp;c. for its continuance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Government in most places in the Christian world; <hi>Ʋpon these grounds,</hi> saith the King, <hi>viz.

               <p>In a word, the King was <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> for Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon these grounds, the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> his <hi>Conscience;</hi> he was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114632:39"/>

Now whether these two may both stand together, without justling one another down, there's the question: As also, whether the King writes more like a Prince and a Divine, or he more like a knave and a fool.</p>
               <p>His next cavil is at the Kings saying, <hi>His judgment was fully satisfied, that had of all other the fullest Scripture ground:</hi> Hereupon he asketh us, <hi>Were it as the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He desired a Synod, to <hi>satisfie</hi> those who would not be <hi>satisfied</hi> with his being so <hi>satisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He desired a Synod, to shew you, that in a matter of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and high insistance, he would not rely upon his own judgment, though it were aboundantly <hi>satisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He desired a Synod, to shew you, how a Synod would be of his opinion; of which he was confident.</p>
               <p>He desired a Synod, because it was not fit that either he, or you, should alter the Government of the Church without: he may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ask you, why you would deny him one?</p>
               <p>Your next cavill is, at the Kings assertion, <hi>viz. Since the first age, for 1500 years, not one example can be produced of any setled Church which had not Bishops.</hi> The King puts you to the proof, you should have prov'd it otherwise then with <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands: By the first age,</hi> you say, <hi>is meant the time of the Apostles:</hi> You got nothing by that, for they were they who were the greatest Bishops, in effect, Arch-Bishops; and in their time there were Bishops, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us;</hi> the names, Apostles, Evangelists, Arch-Bishops, Bishops or Presbyters, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our purpose; we dispute not about the name, but the thing: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was over <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> they both were over many Ministers in <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Ephesus;</hi> Episcopacy being nothing else but one Minister over many Ministers, and Episcopacy is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</p>
               <p>For your cavil at the Kings producing <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> it is but a vain objection for you to avoid his reason out of the Etymologie of the word; for the word, Apostle, doth not signifie so much as a Bishop; the word, Bishop, signifying Overseer; and the word, Apostle, but a Messenger. And for your granting, that if they were Overseers of other Ministers (which you cannot deny, being the Scriptures are so plain) yet it was as they were Apostles or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114632:40"/> Evangelists, that is vain; for I never heard before, that ever <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> were Apostles: And for Evangelists, though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids one of them to do the work of an Evangelist: The meaning of that word is only a Preacher of the Gospel; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Minister of the Gospel: This doth not prove him no Apostle; no more doth Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> bidding him do the work of a Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, prove him no Bishop; all these tearms are reciprocall, and may be taken for one another: but if we can prove in the Apostles time, that one Minister of the Gospel exercis'd jurisdiction over other Ministers of the Gospel; we have prov'd enough for Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy in the <hi>first age and purest times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For your confuting the Kings <hi>argument of reason,</hi> you must bring <hi>reason</hi> to confute it; you are not, <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> that we must take your word so often with out <hi>reason,</hi> or so much as common sense; railing for reason is a quick, but no good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Neither doth it prove the late King to be of any other Religion, then what he profess'd himself; because he is loath to give a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to Papists, that doth not suppose him to be willing to give the least scandall to Protestants.</p>
               <p>Neither is it any wonder, why the late King should call the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, especially only those Protestants which were against Episcopacy, but a handfull; for in comparison they were no more.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any reason for your cavilling at the late Kings giving those who were disciplin'd by Episcopacy, <hi>the Christian world;</hi> for he included his own Dominions: Or, if otherwise, though you may say something to their Doctrine, yet they may be Christian in their Discipline: but I see you would fain find a knot in a Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush, and cannot.</p>

               <p>I don't thinke it did: I should thinke that the calling did only give them a right to parle with His Majesty, and that his parling with them, made it a Parliament: I do not thinke it is a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till after the Sestion; there is a case that I have read to that purpose, if I am not much deceiv'd (I have no time to search books) stated in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her time; Shee called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Writs were issued out to meet at such a day; the day that was appointed for their meeting, the Queen fell sick, and came not to the House until the next day, or some days after; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon equestion rose, from what time the Parliament should bear its date, whether from the time that they were appointed by Writ, or from the time that the Queen sate in the House; it was put to the Lawyers, &amp; they all resolved upon the question, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to bear date from the time that the Queen sate in the House, for there could be no Parliament without a Session.

                  <hi>pulling downe crosses which were but civill, not Religious markes,</hi> and why? because <hi>they were not placed in houses, but Churches,</hi> they were placed amongst the <hi>houses</hi> as well as in <hi>Churches,</hi> witnesse <hi>Cheapside</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Crosse;</hi> and yet I believe you did not see such frequent bowing, and cringing, with cap and knee, to either of them.</p>
               <p>For your asking the Doctor whether it were not <hi>as good reason to set up the statue of Judas, as the figure of the Crosse:</hi> I answer, you doe not oppose them rightly: you should have opposed to the statue of <hi>Judas,</hi> the statue of Christ: and if you would have gon any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you should have opposed to the Crosse of Christ, the figure of the gallowes that <hi>Judas</hi> hung himself upon; and you should have left the Crosse to them that had a mind to it; and have taken the other to your self; and so all parties had been well pleased.</p>
               <p>For your objection out of the <hi>old Law,</hi> I have formerly answered you, why the Crosse was so much accounted of amongst the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; only I shall add, as to the present purpose, that there is a great <hi>deal</hi> of difference, between that which is any way, <hi>instrumentall</hi> to the least evil; and that was so much <hi>instrumentall</hi> (as you call it) to so much good, as the salvation of all mankind.</p>
               <p>You tell us of <hi>Josiah</hi> his cutting down the groves and woods, wherein were placed their Idols, and their Altars; but I must tell you, that it is not yet concluded on by the major part of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, no nor Protestants neither, that glas-windows, or Crosses, or monuments, are such Idols as you make them: but if they were, none did, or could doe this, but <hi>Josiah. Josiah</hi> cut down the Groves; but you have cut down your <hi>Josiah:</hi> and now I pray you give me leave to use some of your own words, I have not done it a long time; they lye in my way; <hi>viz. Behold then how Peters follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have swarved in practice from that blessed Apostle; and what a good sign of Protestantism this painter hath hung up at the late Kings own door. viz.</hi> his own head.</p>
               <p>As to your cavill at the Kings complaint at <hi>the defacing of the monuments and inscription of the dead;</hi> you have put in <hi>popish,</hi> before <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions; inscriptions</hi> before <hi>monuments: Or,</hi> between both, instead of <hi>And;</hi> to make his words the more ugly like the percecutors of the primitive Christians, who put Bears skins upon the Christians backs, that their dogs may fasten upon them. <hi>Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> you put first, as thinking it to have the broader shoulders, and therefore able<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Then (you say there) <hi>follows one thwack more, to make room for the Common-prayer book, and drive out the new Catechisme.</hi> You follow your businesse close indeed: he speaks not one word to any thing of all which the King objects: <hi>viz.</hi> The leaving of all Ministers to such liberty in their private devotions, that no Christian can tell to what he may say, Amen: speaks not a word to the objected er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, blasphemies, ridiculous undecencies, boldnesse, ignorance, in their prayers and peachings; not a word saith he to any of all this: but fals <hi>thwack</hi> upon the poor <hi>Catechisme,</hi> he means to make that pay for all; and that he doth to some purpose: for he tels you, <hi>it is not as the King saies;</hi> but as <hi>he saies;</hi> which is all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that break.</p>
               <p>To that part of the Chapter which you say, you <hi>doubt nothing,</hi> I <hi>doubt</hi> as little; <hi>viz. that Christs Kingdome might have been set up without pulling down the late Kings.</hi> But where you come with your <hi>excipe quod jus; viz. had not such Priests as himself, perswaded the late King not to suffer it &amp;c.</hi> as whose self? as the Kings selfe? have you left the Doctor, and now have you brought the King to be a Priest? I feare me, you will find him a Prophet too, ere it be long.</p>
               <p>For <hi>your confidence, that Christs government would have confirmed the late Kings (if he had not done as the Doctor made him (you say) professe</hi> &amp;c.) I shall only answer you in the Kings own words, <hi>Had some men truly intended Christs government, or knew what it meant in their hearts; they could never have been so ill governed in their words and actions, both against Me, and one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, The King speaks as plainly as a man can speak; <hi>viz. Christs government will confirm mine; not overthrow it, since as I own mine from him, so, I desire to rule for his glory, and his Churches good.</hi> Yet will this <hi>Vafar</hi> be snarling at these words; with his wresting them otherwise then to his intended purpose; as if the King should mean hereby, his obedience to the Pope; because he stiles him Christs Vicar, <hi>Et si no aliqua nocuisset mortuus esset.</hi>

               <p>For your endeavour to wave the Kings instance, in <hi>Noahs</hi> sons practice, it is but a vain attempt; for it is not enough for you to say, it is apparent that they went backward and covered his shame; for he never went backward and covered his shame, who first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it: besides, that was not all his fault, but he went and made remonstrance of it to his brethren; so that no thanks to him, that they might not do so too, which they might have done, had they had as little grace as he; his duty had been to have covered him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and ne'r have told his brethren of it: And for your jeering us with <hi>Servus servorum, Gregor.</hi> which is nothing at all, either to us, or to our purpose: but I will tell you what is to both, I am afraid that these cursed <hi>Chams,</hi> discoverers of their Fathers nakednesse, Remonstrancers, &amp;c. have brought such a curse upon the Nation,

               <p>You ask, <hi>what example of safety could the Scotch Chronicles more afford, that he should chuse rather to trust them then you?</hi> To which it might be answered, First, he was their native Prince; Secondly, they invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, he had reason to take the first offer: And I will tell you an inducement beyond all this, to which all instances of Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles must give place, and that is, an old custome amongst them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd never to be violated, which might put confidence in the late King, which was, the unviolable laws belonging to their deadly feud.</p>
               <p>Where this deadly feud is once begun, and entred into (by that

               <p>I wonder why this fellow should fancy the Kings Chaplaines to be <hi>frogges?</hi> they never played at skip-frogge with their brethren, in leaping into Benefices over other mens heads, as <hi>our pious orthodox Divines have done,</hi> they never entred so unwelcomely into the Kings Chamber, as the <hi>frogges</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> did into King <hi>Pharoahs</hi> presence, as a plague unto him; croaking, is to be understood, harsh and unpleasing sounds, such as the Chaplaines which you would have sent, did use to make in the Kings ears: might he have had his own Chaplaines, they would have made better musick: therefore good Mr. Confuter, the frogges be yours, they are so like you, that it is pity to take them from you.</p>

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:114632:50"/>
               <p>But you tell us, the King must be neither <hi>ingenious,</hi> nor <hi>charitable,</hi> nor <hi>Christian,</hi> if he <hi>interprets this deniall amisse;</hi> they have such a care of his <hi>soul and body,</hi> that they will not let him have the liberty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his body, or his mind.</p>

               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Doctor represents the late King grandly wicked:</hi> how so Sir? <hi>because be accounts good, honest, and religious company, worse then solitude.</hi> If you had let the King to have had his own Chaplains, it was those which he would have had; he wanted no companions, were they never so boon; it is no marvell if the King prefer'd solitude before such sawcy company as he should have had of them; they were not to be all fellows at the ball he was to tosse: and I would fain have you tell me, how many <hi>peals of oaths</hi> you have heard rung by the Kings Chaplains? <hi>Calumniare fortiter, aliquid adbaerebit:</hi> is that your plot? you shall have it.</p>
               <p>You appeal <hi>to all understanding mens judgements, whether heaven would not be more uncouth then a wildernesse, to the late King; in preferring Solitude, before good, civill, honest and religious company:</hi> what if they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? what if a thousand to one throughout Christendome thought otherwise? what if the King himself thought them not good? uncivill, impious knaves and hypocrits: wil you not give a man leave to judge his own liquor by his own palate? nor his own meat by his own tast? we know that nothing is more ordinary then for hereticks &amp; Schismaticks, to cry up themselves, to be the only men in the right, and all the world besides themselves, to be in an error: as the <hi>Donatists, Nulla salus nist ex parte Donati:</hi> No salvation, but to believe as doe the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</hi> These two, <hi>viz.</hi> Libertines, and the Donatists, would have been fitter companions a great deal then the King; and your Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Buchanonians.</p>
               <p>You will not have <hi>this deniall seem a greater rigour and barbarity, then is ever used by Christians, to the meanest prisoners;</hi> because you say, <hi>the Spanish inquisition is worse; and so was the high Commission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, had you travelled with the late King into <hi>Spain,</hi> you would have known that they never used to put any Catholike Subject of the same Religion that the King was of, into any such prison at all, as you doe put a Protestant King into an inquisition; who is of the same Religion with your selves.</p>
               <p>Again, no prison in all <hi>Spain,</hi> ever shut out a prisoners ghostly

And for your <hi>pattern in the mount;</hi> you have exceeded all patterns of mounts or high Commissions in your high Court of Justice, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then all the hils in <hi>Rome,</hi> were they set upon the top of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Peleon upon Ossa, would be but a mole-hill to it: <hi>Mount Atlas,</hi> if any thing, must come near it; who carries the heavens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his shoulders, which he could soon bring down and incorporate with the lower Globe.</p>
               <p>What doe you tell us of your <hi>Grandsire Bonner,</hi> and <hi>Queen Maries daies?</hi> here are Protestants hindred to come to Protestants; what is the other to our purpose? were they not Protestants who kept were out, by the Authority of a Papist Queen? But the King complains heer of a <hi>Protestant</hi> King, his being <hi>denyed,</hi> by his <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects, to have his <hi>Protestant</hi> Chaplains, to doe their <hi>Protestant</hi> duty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> can you bring me the like of this in all the world?</p>
               <p>For your calling his Majesties Chaplains, Arminians, Papists and superstitious: you are necessitated thereunto; for they who doe things they are ashamed of, must tell a lye for shame; and must not think that their greatest shame consists in lying: thus have I seen people out-face others in a truth, with much pleasure to themselves, and high food to their choller, whilst others have dasht them out of countenance, with blushing for them: But I doe think you will call so many honest and good men papists, as is enough to bring popery into request again.</p>
               <p>You say very well, that <hi>you little conceive any analogy between theirs and the Parliaments deniall:</hi> The Kings request having only an eie to holy conversation; your <hi>denyall squinting at the perverting of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and turning them aside into blind paths leading only to their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the King had no reasan to <hi>conceive</hi> those, <hi>who had so great an influence, in occasioning those calamities, and inflicting those wounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him,</hi> to be his <hi>proper Physitians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next break, you compare the Parliament to <hi>the true Daniel, and servants of the most high God;</hi> the Liturgie of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to <hi>Bell;</hi> and Episcopacy to the <hi>Dragon:</hi> Now we will see who are likest <hi>Bell,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and so we shall come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true <hi>Daniel.</hi>

               <p>THese Seraphick contemplations, and vows, distilled from the lymbeck of his princely soule, heated by those fyry tryals, sends forth the purest spirits of his devotion, which he cals forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, because <hi>they doe not agree with the late Kings actions: being never guilty of so specious resolves and pretended penitence.</hi>
